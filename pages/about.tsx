                    My name is Jordan Barbosa, and I have been programming since I was about 14
                    years old. I started off learning HTML and PHP (strange right?!), but soon after
                    started to learn JavaScript. I hated JavaScript, then I quickly learned jQuery,
                    and that made JavaScript a little better.
                  </p>

                  <p className="about-paragraph">
                    Now with the rise of other more advanced frameworks and libraries, I started to
                    move into the Angular side, but quickly changed to React. I now focus on Reactjs
                    (and Redux for state managment) with TypeScript. With the backend I focus on
                    NodeJS to keep everything JavaScript (I love it now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) I love to
                    problem solve, and to find better ways to do current things.
